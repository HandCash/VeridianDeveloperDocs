# Introduction

Payment Requests are a powerful solution that allows your products to accept payments from any wallet powered by Veridian (including [HandCash](https://handcash.io/)).

You should consider using Payment Requests when:

* You need to accept casual payments in your app instead of high-frequency payments.

* You want to offer an alternative checkout flow to your existing payment methods.

# Use Cases

Payment Requests are designed to be simple to integrate while offering powerful features through its API and webhook system. This combination of simplicity and flexibility makes it ideal for various use cases:

1. **Paywalls**: Allow users to pay to unlock content from your app, such as playing a game or reading an article. Your server will be notified every time a payment is successfully completed.

2. **Pay-as-you-go**: Require a payment to use your product. Instead of requesting a subscription to use your product, you can request a small payment.

3. **Checkouts**: Accept payments for your business quicklyâ€”the quickest way to accept BSV and stablecoins.

4. **Purchase Single Items**: Generate individual and reusable payment links for each app item. Your server will be notified every time a payment is successfully completed.

## Real-World Example

The [HandCash Items market](https://market.handcash.io) is built on top of Payment Requests. In this implementation:

1. Every time an item is listed, a payment request is created for that item.

2. When a purchase is made, the purchaser is transferred the item.

This demonstrates how Payment Requests can create a robust marketplace system.

# Getting Started

   Use your `appSecret` and `appId` to start triggering payments in your application. Refer to the [developer dashboard guide](/developer=dashboard) for instructions for creating an app.
