## Introduction

Wallet API supports the most essential wallet functions with an easy-to-use SDK, allowing any developer to integrate blockchain into their platform in just a few minutes.

It offers the following features:

- **Create wallets** â€” create and restore wallets
- **Get balances** â€” retrieve aggregated token balances
- **Get transaction history** â€” access all previous transactions
- **Get deposit information** â€” learn different methods to transfer assets to any wallet
- **Transfer tokens** â€” send any token with just a few lines of code.
- **Transfer NFTs** â€” transfer any NFT with a few lines of code.
- **Store data** â€” save any arbitrary piece of information (hex data, JSON, etc.) on the blockchain with minimal code.

## Set up

To get started with Wallet API:

1. Create an application in the [Developer Dashboard](/developer-dashboard)
2. Save your `AppSecret` and `AppId` for later use
3. Install the Veridian SDK in your project:

```
npm install --save @veridian/sdk
```

## Wallet Custody Models

We offer two different custody models for wallets, depending on your needs.

#### **Distributed-Custody Wallet**

The best way to onboard new users. It does not require users to store complicated user mnemonics that they don't understand, can lose, or expose, which could lead to hacking.\
\
Create wallets that your users can create and restore by verifying their email address. Protected by MPC (multi-party computation).

#### **Self-Custody Wallet**

The quickest way to create and manage self-custody wallets. You are responsible for creating and protecting the wallet's private keys that control the assets.

It provides more flexibility by not requiring users to verify their email addresses, but it also introduces complexity on your side to manage the private keys. You become the wallet custodian.

## Next Steps

Choose the wallet custody model that suits you best and deploy your first app in minutes ðŸš€.
